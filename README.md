# LoserAndrew_2DUnityGame

## Description 
Loser Andrew is a 2D platformer featuring a modest boy named Andrew. During his studies, he became lazy and failed to fulfill a promise to complete a shooting game before week 12. As a result, he was turned into a toad by magical powers and placed into a computer game. Assist the smelly and uneducated toad in transforming back into a boy by overcoming challenges, punishing him, and collecting 7 magical bananas.

## How-To-Play
1. You are the toad named Andrew, and your main goal is to collect 7 magical bananas on the map and make it to the finish; otherwise, you will not be able to pass the level.
2. Be careful as on your way to the end, you might encounter many traps. But do not be afraid; if you die, all collected bananas stay in your inventory. If you passed some checkpoints but forgot to collect bananas, you can use the pause menu by pressing the Escape button and then restart the level by pressing the Restart button.
3. Your character can move left or right using the A or D keys or the arrow keys, and jump with the Space key.
4. In total, there are three different levels, each containing seven bananas, along with checkpoints featuring traps. If you find this game challenging, do not worry I have tested everything and after many days of crying I successfully completed my game. So, cheer up and good luck!

## Game Design 
The main character is a toad named Andrew, to pass the prescribed punishments and get out of the game universe, the player must collect unusual bananas; if the character does not collect 7 bananas, he will not be able to complete the level. The main obstacle to achieving the goal will be pre-prepared traps such as (saws, spikes, moving platforms)
which will not be easy to overcome. The only thing the main character can do is jump and run. However, you need to be precise when choosing decisions, otherwise, the boy will be stuck in the game forever. The game consists of 3 different levels with different obstacles.

## Level Design
Background, Terrain (main area where a character can walk), Collectible Items (Collectible items must be collected to finish the level), Traps (if a character falls into one of the traps he dies, and the level restarts), Main Character (The main character can move in different directions using the A or D keys and jump using the Space key.), Finish (If the player collects all collectible items, they pass the level.)
